To learn more about the rasters included in the product package, refer to the [Exploring Sentinel-1 InSAR StoryMap](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/8be186e4125741518118d0102e6835e5 \"Exploring Sentinel-1 InSAR StoryMap https://arcg.is/11DaW90\" ) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The *amplitude* image is the calibrated radiometric backscatter from the reference granule in sigma-nought power. The image is terrain corrected using a geometric correction, but not radiometrically corrected.\n",
    "- The *coherence* file pixel values range from 0.0 to 1.0, with 0.0 being completely non-coherent and 1.0 being perfectly coherent.\n",
    "- The *unwrapped phase* file shows the results of the phase unwrapping process. Negative values indicate movement towards the sensor, and positive values indicate movement away from the sensor. This is the main interferogram output.\n",
    "- The *wrapped phase* file indicates the interferogram phase after applying the adaptive filter immediately before unwrapping. Values range from negative pi to positive pi. *(optional)*\n",
    "- The *line-of-sight displacement* file indicates the displacement in meters along the look direction of the sensor. The sign is opposite to that of the unwrapped phase: positive values indicate motion towards the sensor and negative values indicate motion away from the sensor. *(optional)*\n",
    "- The *vertical displacement* is generated from the line of sight displacement values, and makes the assumption that deformation only occurs in the vertical direction. Note that this assumption may not hold true in cases where the deformation also has a horizontal component. Positive values indicate uplift, and negative values indicate subsidence. *(optional)*\n",
    "- The *look vectors* theta (θ) and phi (φ) describe the elevation and orientation angles of the sensor's look direction. *(optional)*\n",
    "- The *incidence angle* maps indicate the angle between the incident signal and the surface normal of either the terrain (local incidence angle) or the ellipsoid (ellipsoid incidence angle). *(optional)*\n",
    "- The *DEM* file gives the local terrain heights in meters, with a geoid correction applied. *(optional)*\n",
    "- The *water mask* file indicates coastal waters and large inland waterbodies. Pixel values of 1 indicate land and 0 indicate water. This file is in 8-bit unsigned integer format.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the **water mask** option is selected, the water mask is applied prior to phase unwrapping to exclude water pixels from the process. The water mask is generated using the [GSHHG](http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhg \"http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/wessel/gshhg/land\" ){target=_blank} dataset. To compile the reference shapefile, the full-resolution L1 dataset (boundary between land and ocean) and L5 dataset (boundary between Antarctic ice and ocean) were combined. The L3 dataset (boundary between islands and the lakes they are within) was removed from the L2 dataset (boundary between lakes and land), and this combined dataset was removed from the combined L1/L5 dataset. The portion of the shapefile covering the scene is converted to a raster for inclusion in the phase unwrapping mask during InSAR processing. The GSHHG dataset was last updated in 2017, so there may be discrepancies where shorelines have changed. Visit our [InSAR Water Masking Tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/485916be1b1d46889aa436794b5633cb \"InSAR Water Masking StoryMap\" ){target=_blank} for more information about water masking.\n",
