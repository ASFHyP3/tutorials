    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will work with [OPERA Level-2 Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera/products/rtc-product) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Backscatter products generated from Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR imagery. These products are processed by the [Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera) project at the [Jet Propulsion Labratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The RTC-S1 products use a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to correct for the distortions inherent to SAR data due to the side-looking geometry used to acquire the imagery. The OPERA project uses the [Copernicus Global 30-m (GLO-30)](https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/collections/copernicus-digital-elevation-model) DEM to produce the RTC-S1 products.\n",
    "\n",
    "OPERA RTC-S1 products are archived in [NASA's Earthdata Cloud (EDC)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/technology/cloud-computing) by the [Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF)](https://asf.alaska.edu/). They are archived as [Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs)](https://www.cogeo.org/), which allows users to work with the data directly in the cloud and generate derived products without having to download the source rasters first. They can be accessed using ASF's Data Search tools via the [Vertex web portal](https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/?zoom=3.000&center=-97.494,39.673&dataset=OPERA-S1&productTypes=RTC), [the ASF Search API]( https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/api/basics/) or using the [asf_search python package](https://docs.asf.alaska.edu/asf_search/basics/).\n",

    "We will use the asf_search python package to search for OPERA RTC-S1 products over San Francisco, California. The RTC-S1 products are generated from indiviual Sentinel-1 SLC bursts, so they have a much smaller footprint than we are accustomed to seeing when working with Sentinel-1 data. Most users work with Sentinel-1 Level 1 products, including GRD and SLC IW products, which package together many individual bursts into larger scenes. Refer to [ASF's Sentinel-1 Burst Tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/88c8fe67933340779eddef212d76b8b8) for more information on this topic.\n",
